# mester-rest-api #

Mester is a suite for Quality Assurance testing (QA).
Mester consists of 3 parts:

1. REST API
2. Front End
3. Mobile Clients

### Basic Capabilities of the REST API ###

* Projects are in a public domain (no registration required)
* Project can be added via POST request
* Project has test cases, which have test steps
* Test case can be added via POST request by project identifier

### Build & Run ###

In order to build & run project, you'll need:

* Eclipse (the fastest IDE to compile Grails, preferably basic distribution like Luna)
* Eclipse GGTS **plugin**
* MySQL DB (community edition is fine)
* Java JDK (I am using JDK 1.8u25 at the moment)
* Grails 2.4.4 or later*
* Groovy 2.3.9 or later*

[*] : it is possible that later versions of language / platform will have some methods used in the project deprecated. For easiest setup, use specified versions

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Currently, project is in read-only mode

### Who do I talk to? ###
